This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project makes use of the [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) component library for some of the design and the react-loading-spinner library for loading state.

The frontend uses Jest for unit testing. To run unit tests, simply do `npm test` or `npx jest` in the terminal.
